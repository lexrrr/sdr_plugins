The files in this archive will add an old-style Magic Eye, or else "Cat's Eye"
to SDR# software (www.airspy.com).
An analog SNR Meter has also been addded.

Setup: 
	*	Please follow the instructions in the text file MagicLine.txt
	*	For recent SDR# Studio just copy the "SDRSharp.MagicEye.dll" in its own folder,
		in the "Plugin" folder tree.
	
It is compiled as 32bit platform, with .NET Framework version 4.6.
Will *not* run on SDR# versions older than r1362 (14 Sept 2015)
Full compatibility with newer SDR# versions using .NET 5.x framework.

This plugin is donated for free to the huge SDR# users community.
As such, I assume no responsibility for any problems the use of this plugin may cause.
You are invited for costructive comments and suggestions.
Any reasonable request might be fulfilled based on my spare time, be patient.

Enjoy!
